For a real implementation, you would place actual image files here with names like:
photo1.jpg
photo2.jpg
photo3.jpg
etc.

For development purposes, you can use placeholder image services like:
https://picsum.photos/200/300
https://placeholder.com/
https://placehold.co/

Example usage in your components:
Replace the image URLs with something like:
'https://picsum.photos/id/10/800/600' for photo1.jpg
'https://picsum.photos/id/11/800/600' for photo2.jpg
etc.
